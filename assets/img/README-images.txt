Hero and tile image placeholders
-------------------------------
Replace any of these by uploading new .webp files with the exact same name:
- hero.webp
- tile-characters.webp
- tile-timeline.webp
- tile-maps.webp
- tile-library.webp
- og-default.webp

Suggested sizes & tips
- Hero: ~1600px wide, cinematic crop, target 150–300 KB.
- Tiles: 800–1200px wide, consistent framing; target under 200 KB.
- Prefer .webp for performance and transparent edges if needed.
- Keep filenames the same; no code changes required.
